# Experience

I most recently worked on new projects using AI/LLM-based data and tech as a Technical Lead at [Zinnia](https://zinnia.com/), primarily with Next.js, Typescript, Postgres, MongoDB, the various OpenAI APIs, and more.

I moved to Switzerland in February 2025 and am searching for a position relevant to my skillset and interests. I am in the Bern area, but am open to moving within Switzerland for the right position. I am a Swiss citizen and native German speaker.
